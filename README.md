- ML-based model to Determine whether an Astronomical Body is Hazardous or not using NASAâ€™s dataset of Celestial Bodies containing its Relative Diameter and Velocity
- Fine-tuned model parameters and optimized accuracy
- Uses the concept of KNN Classification, Naive Bayes Classification and K-Mean Clustering
- Uses Python libraries including NumPy, Pandas, Sklearn, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for data visualization and interpretation.
